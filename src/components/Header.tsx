                Welcome to my home page ‚òïÔ∏è
              </h2>
              <p className="text-xl font-mono p-4 z-30">
                My Name is Hitesh Choudhary and I am a teacher by profession. I
                teach coding to various level of students, right from beginners
                to folks who are already writing great softwares. I have been
                teaching on for more than 10 years now and it is my passion to
                teach people coding. It's a great feeling when you teach someone
                and they get a job or build something on their own. Before you
                ask, all buttons on this website are inspired by Windows 7. In
                past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles
                such as Cyber Security related roles, iOS developer, Tech
                consultant, Backend Developer, Content Creator, CTO and these
                days, I am at full time job as Senior Director at PW (Physics
                Wallah). I have done my fair share of startup too, my last
                Startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+ user with
                various courses and best part was that we are able to offer
                these courses are pricing of 299-399 INR, crazy right üò±? But
                that chapter of life is over and I am no longer incharge of that
                platform. I think we have already complicated the front end too
                much, so I am opting for a simpler solution for my home page and
                this is one of the fastest web page on the internet.
